# Student-Management-System-Using-Python
This project was made as a requirement for a python internship I had admitted into. 

It is a Python GUI based on Tkinter. The data is stored using oracle. To maximize the usage and my personal understanding of python, I have included multiple libraries such as sockets, requests, beautiful soup, matplotlib, numpy, pandas, pygame, and winsound. 

This program accepts roll no., name and marks of a particular student and adds them to the database. It also checks for various parameters like duplicate roll no, name containig digits and marks not in the range of 0-100. The program allows to perform basic CRUD opeartions on the database. It also displays the city it is being accessed from and the temperature of that city along with a quote of the day. 

To include a data science aspect, I have added an option to generate graphs of the marks achieved by various students.  

To run this project,
1. Make sure you have modules socket, requests, bs4, matplotlib, numpy, pandas, pygame and ttkthemes installed. 
2. Change the 'oracle_username/orace_password' at line nos 49, 73, 130, 187, 218, 245 to your corresponding username and password. 
3. Get an openweathermap api ID and place it at line no. 291.  

Hope you like the project!
